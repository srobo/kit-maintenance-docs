# Competition Mode USB stick check

## Equipment

 * Internet access, or a copy of make-zip locally
 * Laptop
 * ODROID
 * ODROID Power cable
 * Power Board
 * Battery
 * USB stick
 * Competition mode usb sticks
 * USB hub
 * USB A-B cable
 * USB micro cable
 * a power board power loop, or:
  * wire
  * 7mm CamCon
  * Wire cutters

## Procedure

*Setup time*: 5 minutes

1. Make a power loop for the power board
1. Assemble the minimal kit into a kit
1. Put a robot.zip onto the USB stick with the following code in:
``` python
import time
from pprint import pprint
from sr.robot import Robot

R = Robot()

pprint({
    'zone': R.zone,
    'mode': R.mode,
})

if R.mode != 'comp':
    # error that we're not in comp mode
    R.power.beep(500, note='a')
    exit("not comp mode")

for _ in range(R.zone + 1):
    R.power.beep(200, note='d')
    time.sleep(0.4)
```
1. Run that code, so you know what the error sounds like

*Execution time*: 20 seconds per USB stick.

 1. Plug in a comp-mode stick to test
 1. Run `./scripts/comp_usb_test.py /path/to/mount/point`.
 1. Check that it prints the arena and zone the same as the physical label for
    the USB stick
 1. Check that it prints a success message
    (if successful the script will unmount the stick, so it can be removed
    immediately)

Also, to check that the sticks work in kit; for an example of each arena/corner:
 1. Plug the comp-mode stick into the kit
 1. Boot the kit, after the start button is pressed it should beep for one more
    time than the number of the corner, i.e: corner 2 should beep three times
